Next.js Project Setup and Basics

Welcome to the alx-project-0x02-setup repository.
This project is created to document and practice the foundational setup of a Next.js application, including its folder structure, core features, and initial configurations.

The goal of this repository is to help build confidence in working with Next.js from scratch — setting up the environment, understanding pages, components, routing, and preparing the base for more advanced frontend engineering tasks.
